￼How To Download Audio From YouTube Videos Directly On Your Phone

    

Last year, a free online service called Peggo won many netizens who use YouTube to check out their favourite songs. As it allowed its users to transform a video from any platform like Google in an MP3 file, and you can even choose a specific portion of the clip to extract only your audio to the PC as well.

The novelty is that the Peggo has been released for mobile devices, although at the moment the only edition for Android is available. This app has exactly the same functions of the original software and is a great way to download tunes in MP3 directly through their mobile phone, without a computer.


It is very easy to use, but first, you must install the utility in an unconventional way. It is not yet being distributed on Google Play, so you need to click here to get the APK. Place the document in the memory of your smartphone (internal or SD card) and run it through a file manager of your choice.

How To Access Blocked Website From Your Android Device

The Peggo interface is very simple. On your home screen, just enter the video link which you want to make audio or use it as a search box by entering keywords to find the clip in question. When you find the desired book, touch and use the slider to define which part of the video want to be converted into MP3 (useful for those who want to catch only a snippet of a melody to use as a ringtone).


If you want, enable the options “Remove Silence” (to remove the silence that starts and ends the clips) and “Normalize” (to equalize the volume). The user can also edit the title of the song and its artist. With everything ready, tap the blue button labelled “Record MP3”, the job will be placed in the internal list of downloads Peggo and a push notification will be issued when it finished downloading the document.
